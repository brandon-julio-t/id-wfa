### Project goal
Show job openings of various Indonesian companies that have declared themselves as WFH.
Normalize implementing RSS feed for Indonesian job postings.

### Strategy
Starting out, let's manually scrape the career pages of companies that have declared themselves
to be doing WFA. Use [this tweet](https://twitter.com/antonybudianto/status/1471428324140347397) as reference.

Tweet the initial MVP out. If it got enough traction, ask company to DM us if they want their job opening listed. We'll ask them to implement an RSS feed for their career pages.
