# id-wfa ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©

This project scrapes job openings from Indonesian companies that have publicly
announced that they provide WFA (work-from-anywhere) perks to their employees.
The job openings list page is implemented using [Next.js incremental static regeneration](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration)
and will be revalidated at most every 24 hours.

The initial version of this project uses this [tweet](https://twitter.com/antonybudianto/status/1471428324140347397) and this [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CccNFOiPmHR/) as a reference for the companies list.

Number of companies included in this project can increase/decrease as appropriate.

## For companies

### If you would like your company to be removed from the site
Please [file an issue](https://github.com/jackyef/id-wfa/issues/new) and I'll get to it.

### If you would like your company to be included in the site 
Please [file an issue](https://github.com/jackyef/id-wfa/issues/new) with the following included:
- an image URL to the company logo
- a link to your company jobs list page 
- a related announcement as a proof that your company provides full WFA perks, as in not requiring employees to come to the office at all permanently. 

Though, I can't guarantee I can collect the data myself from the job list page!
For better support, please provide an endpoint that returns the job data. If you are not sure what this is, ask your dev team, this can be an XML (RSS, feed), plain REST returning a JSON or a GraphQL endpoint. The amount of data this project needs is very little:

```ts
type JobOpening = {
  jobTitle: string;
  url: string; // url to the job opening detail page,
  company: string;
  departmentName: string; // Engineering, Design, etc.
};
```

### Disclaimer

This project is not affiliated with any of the companies listed. Some information might be inaccurate/incomplete, including but not limited to:

1. Job openings that are included in the site, but apparently not WFA-friendly
2. Job openings that are WFA-friendly but not included in the site
